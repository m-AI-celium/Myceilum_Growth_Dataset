# Mycelium Growth and Structural Compression Datasets

This repository contains a dataset for monitoring mycelium growth, including images, geometrical parametres and structural testing data. The dataset was created as part of a thesis project within the [Integrative Technologies and Architectural Design Research](https://www.itech.uni-stuttgart.de/) ITECH MSc. Program at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/) in 2023.

## General Information

This dataset was created by Hussamaldeen Gomaa, Yara Karazi, and Wai Man Chau, supervised by Eliza Biala and Zuardin Akbar, under the [ITECH MSc. Program](https://www.itech.uni-stuttgart.de/) at the University of Stuttgart in 2023. The collaboration involved the Department for Computing in Architecture at the Institute for Computational Design and Construction (ICD/CA), the Institute of Building Structures and Structural Design (ITKE), and the Institute for Building Construction (IBK).
